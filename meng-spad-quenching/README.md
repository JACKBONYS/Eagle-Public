#meng-spad-quenching

This repository contains circuit designs for my M.Eng. project in Professor Rajeev Ram's group at MIT. These circuits are primarily related to quenching single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) fabricated in 90nm CMOS through MOSIS. My thesis (available at the end of Spring 2018) will contain full documentation.
